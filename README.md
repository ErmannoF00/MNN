# Memristive Neural Network Simulation

This project provides a simplified approach to simulating an 'in-situ' training paradigm of a memristor crossbar neural network. It focuses on iteratively updating the weights of crossbars defined in netlist files, with memristor models also specified in these files, running multiple simulations until convergence.

## Project Structure

- **Python Scripts**: Handle the updating of crossbar weights based on simulation results.
- **Netlist Files**: Define the memristor models and network architecture for simulation purposes.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary simulation tools and Python environment configured.
2. **Configure Netlist Files**: Define your memristor models and network architecture within the provided netlist files.
3. **Run Simulations**: Execute the Python scripts to perform iterative simulations, updating crossbar weights until the network converges.

## Notes

- This project offers a basic framework for memristive neural network simulation and may require customization to fit specific applications.
- Familiarity with circuit simulation and Python programming is recommended for effective utilization.
